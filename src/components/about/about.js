        <div className="title-text one">
          The idea of Boom.Camp was born out of the struggle of it's parent
          company <a href="https://boomsourcing.com/">Boomsourcing</a> to find
          developers with the needed skills co-located with the facilities
          Boomsourcing already had available in the Philippines. The company
          leadership at Boomsourcing knows there's a vast amount of talent in
          the Philippines, but still found it difficult to find people with the
          specialized skills they were looking for. With the success of various
          boot-camp style development training programs in the U.S.A
          Boomsourcing felt they could develop their own unique program that
          could bring talented I.T. and computer science graduates up to speed
          with the skills needed by the development team at Boomsourcing. In
          addition to bringing developers onto the internal teams at
          Boomsourcing, the company also would like to be able to provide
          workforce augmentation and custom development services to clients.
          That's basically why Boom.Camp has come to exist today.

          Boom.Camp aims to bring student developers to a Junior Developer level
          of proficiency in modern front-end and backend development. The
          curriculum is comprised mainly of web programming concepts (HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript). By the end of the course, a student developer should be
          able to join an existing development team and make contributions to
          utilize the skill they acquired.
